**Simple cross-platform (Android & Windows) application using C++ and C# .NET MAUI**

---

## Project Purpose

This project is designed to explore and demonstrate **cross-platform application development** using a hybrid tech stack:

- **Backend:** C++
- **Frontend:** C# using .NET MAUI  

The application allows users to:

- Create nodes on a graph using **latitude and longitude values**  
- Link nodes together to form **edges**, creating a complete graph  
- Compute the **shortest traversal** between two nodes using the **A* algorithm**  
- **Save and load** graphs between sessions  

The purpose of this project is to study scalable cross-platform development and showcase practical skills in both C++ and C#.

---

## Features

- Add nodes with latitude/longitude  
- Connect nodes with edges to form a graph  
- Find shortest path using A* search  
- Save and load graphs  
- Cross-platform support for **Windows** and **Android**

---

## Dependencies

- **.NET / MAUI** for frontend  

---

## Building the Project

### Backend (C++)

### Frontend (C# MAUI)

1. Install .NET SDK and MAUI workload  
2. Open the `frontend` folder in **Visual Studio**  
3. Reference the built backend shared library (DLL)  
4. Build and run
